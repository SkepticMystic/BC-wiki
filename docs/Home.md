Welcome to the Breadcrumbs wiki! Here you can find more detailed explanations of the various functions of Breadcrumbs.

The Breadcrumbs plugin gives you a way to visualise a custom-built hierarchy in your Obsidian vault.
You supply the structure, Breadcrumbs helps you see and navigate it.

The first and most important topic is [relationships](Getting%20Started/Relationships.md). This is how you create the structure.

Next, you need to set up your [hierarchies](Getting%20Started/Hierarchies.md). Once those are in place, you can use two different [views](Getting%20Started/Views.md) to visualise and navigate it.
