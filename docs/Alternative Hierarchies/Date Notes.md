## Date Notes

Enable _Date Notes_ under `Settings > Alternative Hierarchies > Date Notes`. You also need to provide the format of your daily note names in **Luxon** format (which is different to Moment's syntax). Be sure to checkout [the docs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=table-of-tokens) to find the right syntax.

Once enabled, Breadcrumbs will try to link all your daily notes together using the field provided (`next`, by default).

This means you don't have to manually add any Breadcrumbs to your daily notes for them to be linked together.
