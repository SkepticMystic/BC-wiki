## Regex Notes

A regex note is declared using `BC-regex-note: /regex/flags`.

Any note name in your entire vault that matches the regex will be added to the Breadcrumbs graph using the field provided in `BC-regex-note-field: field`, or the default field under `Settings > Alternative Hierarchies > Regex Notes > Default Field`, or the first field in your hierarchies as a last resort.
