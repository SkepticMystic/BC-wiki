## Folder Notes

This feature lets you add to your hierarchy using your existing folder structure.

Go to a note you want to act as the index, and add `BC-folder-note: fieldName` to it's metadata. This will add an edge from the folder-note to all other notes in that folder, using the `fieldName` specified.
